# 🧟‍♂️ VR Escape Prototype  
### _Physics. Parkour. Panic. Built for Quest 3 in Unity 6._

Welcome to the start of a chaotic little VR project where the goal is simple:  
**escape an alley full of horrors using a gun, your hands, and questionable choices.**

This repo is currently **freshly born**.  
No features yet. No gameplay. Only ambition, dreams, and probably future bugs.

# 🎯 Game Concept

A VR escape game that combines:

- Physical gun handling  
- Parkour and climbing  
- Unforgiving physics  
- Realistic weight, jank, and tension  
- Zombies (or something equally rude)

You begin in an alley with a rifle on your back and a pistol on your hip.  
You climb, scramble, slip, drop things, and try to escape before the undead turn you into a snack.

# 🔧 Planned Core Features

### 🔫 Weapon Physics
- Rifle that sinks when held with one hand  
- Pistol on your side you can grab anytime  
- Guns can fall off surfaces if you place them badly  
- No magical stability… if you drop your gun that’s your problem

### 🧗 Parkour & Climbing
- Pull yourself up using boxes, ledges, or even using your gun as leverage  
- Movement relies on actual physics forces  
- No sticky snapping hands

### 🧟 Enemies
- Zombies or infected creatures  
- You don’t stand and fight  
- You **escape**

### 🎒 Inventory / Holsters
- Rifle on your back  
- Pistol on your hip  
- Maybe a backpack for future items

# 📦 Current State of the Project

🚧 **Nothing is built yet.**  
This README marks the beginning.  
First steps will be setting up XR, basic interactions, and prototyping the weapon weight system.

# 🗺️ Roadmap (Early Stages)

- Set up Unity 6 project  
- Set up XR Interaction Toolkit (Quest 3 via Link)  
- Basic rig, hands, and grabbing  
- Implement rough weapon prefabs  
- Basic climbing test with boxes  

### Later
- Enemy AI  
- Escape level  
- Inventory  
- Death / retry loop  
- Scream internally

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Unity 6  
- Meta Quest 3  
- XR Interaction Toolkit  
- Unity Input System

# 🌟 Why This Exists

Because parkour + physics + VR guns = chaotic fun.  
And because making a VR game that’s unforgiving, heavy, and immersive feels more alive than yet another wave shooter.
