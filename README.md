# 🧟‍♂️ VR Escape Prototype  
### _Physics. Parkour. Panic. Built for Quest 3 in Unity 6._

A physics-driven VR escape prototype focused on **weight, instability, and bad decisions**.  
This is not a power fantasy. This is a “don’t drop your gun while climbing” fantasy.

The goal is simple: **escape**.

## 🎯 Game Concept

A VR escape game built around:

- Physical gun handling with real weight  
- Parkour and climbing using physics forces  
- Minimal assistance, no sticky hands  
- Tension over comfort  
- Enemies that pressure you to move, not fight  

You start in a tight alley with a rifle on your back and a pistol on your hip.  
You climb, scramble, lose balance, drop things, panic, recover, and escape… or you don’t.

## 🔧 Core Design Pillars

- **Physics first**  
  Weight, torque, leverage, and gravity matter.

- **Unforgiving interaction**  
  If you place an object badly, it falls.  
  If you hold a rifle with one hand, it sinks.

- **Movement through environment**  
  You escape by climbing, pulling, vaulting, and improvising.

- **Pressure, not power**  
  Enemies exist to rush you forward, not to be farmed.

## 📦 Current State of the Project

### ✅ Done
- [x] Repository created  
- [x] Core concept defined  
- [x] Tech stack decided  
- [x] Project structure planned  
- [x] Unity 6 project setup  

### 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] XR foundation planning  
- [ ] Interaction and physics approach design  
- [ ] Project settings baseline (rendering/input)  
- [ ] Quest build settings pass  
- [ ] XR scene bootstrapping (rig + hands)  

### ❌ Not Implemented Yet
- [ ] Gameplay systems  
- [ ] Weapons  
- [ ] Climbing  
- [ ] Enemies  
- [ ] Levels  
- [ ] Save/load pipeline  
- [ ] Performance profiling pass  

This is intentionally early. The foundation matters more than rushing features.

## 🔫 Planned Core Features

### Weapon Physics
- Rifle that becomes unstable when held with one hand  
- Pistol holstered on the hip  
- No artificial weapon stabilization  
- Weapons can slide or fall if placed poorly  

### Parkour & Climbing
- Pulling yourself up using ledges, boxes, or props  
- Climbing driven by actual forces, not snapping  
- Slipping, overreaching, and bad grip are possible  

### Enemies
- Zombies or infected creatures  
- They apply pressure  
- Standing still is the wrong choice  

### Inventory / Holsters
- Physical rifle back holster  
- Hip pistol holster  
- Possible backpack system later

## 🌟 Why This Project Exists

Because VR is at its best when it feels **physical**, **messy**, and **dangerous**.  
Because climbing while holding a rifle should be a terrible idea.  
And because escaping by improvisation is more interesting than standing still and shooting waves.

This project is about **weight, panic, and motion**, not comfort.
